Hi, I'm glad you downloaded my plugin! To personalize the plugin you have to read the following text!

In the Config.yml you can edit the messages. Before and after a message there must be an apostrophe('), 
except for numbers and permissions! To get the warp name you can write ${warp}. "${player}" shows the player name 
and ${time} shows the countdown to warp! ${perm} to display the permission! 
If you set the teleport countdown to 0 you will be teleported instantly. To change individual warp-permissions, check Warps.yml!

If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me. You can find all information on my Spigot profile.
